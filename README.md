# Project C
**Chengeta Wildlife**
This project consists of both an Android application and a backend server. The backend server will receive notifications from an MQTT broker and host accounts, all stored in a PostgreSQL database. The front end Android application will access this data and allow users to interact with it.

Created for Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences Project C in year 2, 2022-2023. Project team 5, with members: Saloua Oua-ali, Noah Verkaik, Julian Vink, Matthijs Vos and Salaheddine Zohayri.
